BW_to_Color_Image_Generator

This project is a deep learning–based tool that takes black & white (grayscale) images and colorizes them using a pre-trained Caffe model. The web interface is powered by [Gradio](https://gradio.app), allowing fast and easy interaction. 

Model Info

- Based on a pre-trained Caffe model for image colorization by Rich Zhang.
- Model files:
  - `colorization_deploy_v2.prototxt`
  - `colorization_release_v2.caffemodel`
  - `pts_in_hull.npy`

 Tech Stack

- Python 
- OpenCV 
- Gradio 
- NumPy 
- PIL (Pillow)
